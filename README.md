# SuzyMinesweeper
A version of Minesweeper that features my friend's dog, Suzy.

It is not 100% complete yet. I still want to implement a few more things:
  - A HUD for the score and time
  - When a tile with no surrounding mines is clicked, it reveals all surrounding tiles

I am also trying to get the images to display when combined into a JAR file.
